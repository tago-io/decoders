  "install_text": "The ACW-DINRSM interrogates up to 49 modbus registers from slaves PLCs and sends its answers to LoRa or Sigfox. The devices act as a Master reading and writing into the Slaves to monitor or request on demand specific registers. When connected in serial link, up to 49 PLCs can be controlled by 1x ACW-DINRSM. Data frequency of transmission, registers and slaves requests setup are to be made on the ACW configurator. Compatible with Sigfox repeater (ACW-GW).\n\n**Technical Data**\n* Dimensions: 90 x 57 x 17,9 mm\n* Antenna: External (SMA connector)\n* Temperature: -20°C to +55°C (operation), -40°C to +70°C (storage)\n* Mounts to: DIN rail compliant\n* Power supply: 1x 10-30Vdc\n* Frequency: 865-870 MHz\n* Power: 25 mW (14 dBm)\n* Transfer rate: Sigfox: 100 bit/s, LoRaWAN: 300 bit/s to 10 kbit/s",
