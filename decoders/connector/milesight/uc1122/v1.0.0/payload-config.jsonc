  "install_text": "Milesight UC1122 is designed as a cost-effective industrial machine monitoring device that monitors and controls up to 1 DC signal, 1 drivable relay output and 2 analog inputs. With the aid of Milesight UC1122, the alarm condition brings attention to engineering personnel immediately. The output can be connected with an alarm indication device, such as a light or horn. The module can give immediate response to the status of both the input and output conditions. A LoRa module is embedded in the Milesight UC1122 . \n\n**Parameters**\n* Antenna: 50 Ω SMA Antenna Interface\n* Frequency Band: EU 433, CN 470-510, EU 863-870, IN865, US 902-928, AU 915-928, KR 920-923\n* Sensitivity: -147 dBm @300bps\n* Output Power: 20dBm\n* Protocol: LoRaWAN Class C\n* Analog Input:  4-20 mA (0-5 V Optional).
