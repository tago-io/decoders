  "install_text": "Milesight UC1152 is designed as a cost-effective industrial machine monitoring device that monitors and controls up to 1 RS485, 1 RS232, 1 DC signal and 1 drivable relay output. With the aid of Milesight UC1152, the alarm condition brings attention to engineering personnel\nimmediately. The output can be connected with an alarm indication device, such as a light or horn. The module can give immediate response to the status of both the input and output conditions. A LoRa module is embedded in the Milesight UC1152 . \n\n**Parameters**\n* Antenna: 50 Ω SMA Antenna Interface\n* Frequency Band: EU 433, CN 470-510, IN865, EU 863-870, US 902-928, AU 915-928, KR 920-923\n* Sensitivity: -147 dBm @300bps\n* Output Power: 20 dBm\n* Protocol: LoRaWAN Class C\n* RS485: Baud rate: 2400-115200bps.
